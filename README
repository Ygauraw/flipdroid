Flipdroid - README
--------------------

Introduction - background
-------------------------

This piece of software is a part of the Flipzu stack.

Flipzu was an audio broadcasting system that would let you stream and listen to live audio broadcasts from your cell phone (Android & iOS) or web browser.

The main focus was ease of use: you hit a button, and you were live on your social networks. 

Opening in mid-2010, Flipzu gained a respectable regional traction but ceased operations as of 14th May 2012, due to lack and funding.

This software is provided as-is, since it's not being developed or maintained any more. If you need some aditional information or help, please check the source code for contact information.


Summary
-------

This is the Flipzu application for Android, that would let you stream and listen to live audio content from your cell phone.

This was my first Android app and you could notice by looking at the messy code, BUT there's still interesting bits around, like FlipzuRecorderService.java, which is the multi-threaded recording, transcoding and broadcasting service. You should take a look at that if you aim at doing something similar.

Usage instuctions
-----------------

Dependencies, besides what's included in the "libs" directory:

- ActionBarSherlock: http://actionbarsherlock.com/
- Facebook Android SDK, for facebook login: https://github.com/facebook/facebook-android-sdk

Then import this directory with Eclipse, and start hacking.
